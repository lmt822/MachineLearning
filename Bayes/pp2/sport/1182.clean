I can t believe that the NY Rangers would force its
players to go to Binghamtom to play in the AHL playoffs instead
of letting them represent their countries in the World Championships

Anderrson and Zubov are waiting for the NHL to make a decision to this
while Kovalev has given in and gone down to the minors

The Rangers are a disgrace

ps it has been reported that Neil Smith was very much against
the hiring of Mike Keenan How long will Smith be in NY for

the GodFather
