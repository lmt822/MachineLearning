As a Flyers fan I resent you making Kevin Dineen the butt of your
jokes

If anybody is having problems following the thread be sure to ask the
origonal poster to rectify your misunderstanding

Don t bother looking it up in the appendix it s useless anyway

Just one more word of advice

If you go to a Miami game stay away from any foods made with natural casings
