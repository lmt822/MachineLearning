Well Bruins fans it s playoff time again
It looks like the B s have peaked at the right time
Getting out of the Adams is going to be a cat fight to the end
After what they did to Montreal and Quebec these teams will be out for
revenge If Neely can stay healthy and both Bourque and Moog stay sharp
we should get to see Neely finally take out two years of frustration
on Ulf I don t fight Samuelson I don t agree with fighting in the NHL
but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good it s him

This is going to be a good series Go Bruins
