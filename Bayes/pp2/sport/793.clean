All these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at
NJD they are a very deep team with two very capable goalies and
excellent forwards and defensemen Shooter in Richer an all around do
it all in Todd chef Stasny master of a thousand dishes power play
captain Stevens Take a look at the numbers or play with them and see
for yourselves

Yup I agree with ya I think Devils can beat Red Wings easily SO I think
all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams
before voting I think Islanders and Quebec are much better then I had
expected
