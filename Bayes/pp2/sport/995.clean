The Pittsburgh Penguins games used to be
broadcast on KDKA 1020 but I don t know whether they will be pre empted
by baseball and moved to another station or not You can try those
if the local baseball teams aren t playing at the same time anyway

Randy


The Pens are now being broadcast on 102 5 WDVE
