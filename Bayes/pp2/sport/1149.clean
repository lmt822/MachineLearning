I was watching the Detroit Minnesota game last night and thought I saw an
octopus on the ice after Ysebaert scored to tie the game at two What gives

No no no It s a squid Keep the tradition alive Kinda like the
fish at UNH games

Actually the way I understand it it is an octapus
Apparently a number of years ago a fan threw an octapus on
the ice and the announcer said Octapi will not occupy the ice
or something like that and it s happened ever since The fans
cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands and
boo those who use a shovel
