And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded
resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other
team captain trivia would be appreciated

Wasn t Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to
Pittsburgh

And Rick Tochett was the captain of the Flyers when traded to the Pens
recently

Caleb

And let us not forget that the New Jersey Devils traded
captain Kirk Muller for Stephen Richer and Chorske

Man I hated that trade
