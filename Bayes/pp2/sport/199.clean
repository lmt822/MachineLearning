Also in particular a colleague of mine is looking for any information he
can find on Moe Berg catcher linguist espion of WW2 Any references or
anecdotes for that matter would be appreciated

Moe Berg my hero We were just talking about him on Monday at the
Yankee game Well there s a book about him that s just been reissued
I think the title is Moe Berg Athlete Scholar Spy by Tom Sewell
and two other people whose names I forget Sewell wrote the chapter
on Berg in Danny Peary s book Cult Baseball Players this is a good
source for some of the more famous anecdotes about Berg Also excellent
is the section on him in Bill Gilbert s book They Also Served about
baseball during WWII I m told Berg s spy activities are mentioned in
the recent book Heisenberg s War

His sister also wrote a book about Moe that she self published The
title is something like My Brother Morris Berg It s mainly some of
her memories and page after page of Xerox copies of pictures and letters
that Moe had saved Copies are kinda hard to find but the Smith Baseball
Library has one for those in Minneapolis

We have one here at Berg s alma mater class of 1923 It s kind of
a sour thing she disapproved of the job that Sewell et al had done
