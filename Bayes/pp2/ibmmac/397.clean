Hello netters

I have a question concerning SCSI on DOS

I have a ST01 SCSI controller and two hard disks conected
id s 0 and 1 I d like to connect a SCSI streamer but I
don t have software to access it Does such a beast exist
as shareware or PD

Also what if I want a third disk I know that DOs only can
see two two physical and four logical disks Will it be
possible to use extra disks

Thanks in advance

Ib
