Hi

I just bought a Mitsumi CD ROM drive and a SB Pro soundcard The pin outs on
the CD ROM line out and the SB Pro CD IN are not the same I am considering
taking the RCA output jacks on the Mitsumi interface card and routing them to
the line in input on the SB Pro Will this work with multi media software
that uses the CD ROM and the SB Pro or do I need to go to the CD IN pins on
the SB Pro

Thanks

John
