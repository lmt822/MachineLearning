Could someone please give me some info regarding the USR Sportsters that have
recently dropped below $200? I was going to buy a used Courier v32bis external
without fax for $200 but now I see the Sportster with Fax is selling below
$200 brand new! Are these good modems? What warranty do they carry?

Any info very much appreciated.

Kevin
