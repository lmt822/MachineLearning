I have a SoundBlaster board in a 486 SX PC and I have it
jumpered to IRQ 7 port 220h Will this conflict with my
parallel port I just have an IDE controller a multi IO board
with 2ser 1Par port and a VGA board Should I choose
another IRQ besides 7 Or is IRQ 7 safe to use on 486 Motherboards

Recently I was adding a modem to my computer and I noticed that LPT1 uses
IRQ 7 and so does my SB card 220h I ve never had a problem but I m
just wondering why not I thought this would cause a conflict

I would also like an explanation of this If anyone can explain
why the SB Pro and LPT 1 can share an IRQ please do so
Thanks
