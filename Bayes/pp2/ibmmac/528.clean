I ve been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection
Faults on a 486 33 Eisa VLB system At this point I think I ve narrowed
the problem down to the video drivers for the Volante Warp 10 adapter by
National Design INc

Yet somehow I find this hard to believe Does anyone else have any
experiences with this board
