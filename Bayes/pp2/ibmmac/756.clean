My MacClassic mouse died I dissected it and determined that it is
the microswitch that senses the click that is stuck in the depressed
mode This tragedy prompts the following questions

1 Is it easy to find a microswitch that I could solder into the
place of the old switch

2 I have old mice Max Mac 512Ke can they be used with some
adapter
