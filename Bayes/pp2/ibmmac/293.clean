beta Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS 2 2 0 any longer

Why not This is rather disappointing

If you wish to install the beta from the CD ROM you will need to REM out the
Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic
cards when OS 2 attempts to use them Thanks Adaptec

Yep That s cause the latest and presumably all future Adaptec drivers look
for the string Adaptec or something to that effect in the cards BIOS
