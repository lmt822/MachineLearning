I'm thinking about getting a Toshiba 3401 CD-ROM and hooking it up
through the SCSI port on a Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum sound board.
Does anybody have this configuration out there?  If so, does it work?

For anybody in general who has the Toshiba 3401 CD-ROM drive, have you
had any hadware problems?  Door not opening, scratched disks, door not
closing (getting stuck or not closing all the way), CD holder jamming
and any other CD related problems.

Thanks in Advance

Mark
