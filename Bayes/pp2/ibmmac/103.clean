No buy the serial port and modem Each can be used for other things
you can use the modem with your next computer might not be a PC or
upgrade the modem without changing the box I hear that ISDN is big in
Europe you might be able to get one of those beautiful ISDN modems for
less than the pice of a car someday 64k bidirectional
