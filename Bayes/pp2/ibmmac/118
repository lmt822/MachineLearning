I have a 286 with an M205 motherboard.  The Last Byte memory manager (which
I downloaded for a trial) reports the chipset is an AddTech PCCHIP1 chipset,
and it is able to activate the ram behind segments A000-FFFF, which can then be
used for UMBs (except for video/BIOS).  I would like to write my own driver to
activate the memory.  Does anyone know where I can get programming information
on this chip?

Phil
