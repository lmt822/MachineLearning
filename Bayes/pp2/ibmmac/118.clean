I have a 286 with an M205 motherboard The Last Byte memory manager which
I downloaded for a trial reports the chipset is an AddTech PCCHIP1 chipset
and it is able to activate the ram behind segments A000 FFFF which can then be
used for UMBs except for video BIOS I would like to write my own driver to
activate the memory Does anyone know where I can get programming information
on this chip

Phil
